## Software Installation Steps

__File 1__: Anaconda & Prerequisite Download Instructions (recommended)<br>

__NOTE__: To run or implement the Python code, to build our applications, we will use the Spyder IDE. To avoid any errors in commands such as “pip” in the latest Spyder versions, it is necessary to install Anaconda.

__NOTE__: If any errors persist, install ANACONDA using https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual instead of spyder.org. Follow steps in "File 1" to get it installed.
